# .NET Core 8.0 Web API Project Showcase

🚀 Welcome to the .NET Core 8.0 Web API project, a comprehensive demonstration of best practices in software development. This project emphasizes clean architecture, design patterns, unit testing, and various essential features for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Key Features

### Clean Architecture

Implement a clean and modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The project adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a clear separation of application layers.

### Design Patterns

Showcase the usage of design patterns such as:

- **Repository Pattern 🗃️:** Decouple the data access layer by using repositories.
- **Builder Pattern 🛠️:** Construct complex objects step by step, allowing for a more readable and maintainable codebase.
- **Factory Methods 🏭:** Implement factories for creating objects, enhancing flexibility and testability.
- **Decorator Pattern 🎨:** Dynamically attach responsibilities to objects, demonstrating extensibility.

### Unit Testing

Utilize xUnit as the testing framework along with Moq for creating mock objects. Implement a suite of unit tests covering various aspects of the application to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Fluent Validation

Employ Fluent Validation for validating Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and domain value-objects. Demonstrate how to create clear and expressive validation rules for incoming data.

### Entity Framework Core

Integrate EF Core for data access, showcasing best practices for defining models, migrations, and database interactions. Ensure the use of asynchronous programming for improved performance.

### Exception Handling Middleware

Implement a centralized exception handling middleware to manage and log exceptions gracefully. This middleware should provide meaningful responses to clients while logging detailed information for debugging.

### Token Authentication

Integrate token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to secure API endpoints. Demonstrate how to generate, validate, and refresh tokens, ensuring secure communication between clients and the server.

### Domain Errors

Handle domain-specific errors gracefully by implementing a mechanism to translate domain errors into meaningful responses. Showcase how to maintain a consistent error response format.

### Redis Caching

Integrate Redis caching to enhance performance and reduce the load on the database. Cache frequently accessed data and demonstrate how to invalidate or refresh the cache when necessary.

## Conclusion

This .NET Core 8.0 Web API project serves as a comprehensive showcase of best practices in software development, covering clean architecture, design patterns, unit testing, validation, data access with EF Core, exception handling, token authentication, domain errors, and caching. 🌐 It provides a valuable resource for developers seeking to enhance their skills and build high-quality, maintainable applications. 🚀
